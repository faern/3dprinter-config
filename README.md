# faern's 3d printer setup

Hi and welcome to my stash of:
  * Slicer profiles
  * Printer firmware configurations
  * Hardware build logs, tuning benchmark dumps etc.

Printer specific configuration can be found under the directories with the name of the printer.

## Printers

* [Veiron](Veiron/README.md)

## Firmware config

See `$printer_name/Klipper-config` for the files.

## SuperSlicer profiles

I use SuperSlicer and I originally based everything off of [Ellis SuperSlicer profiles]. I then did
lots of tuning with [Ellis' Print Tuning Guide] and from other sources. The result is versioned in
this repository under `$printer_name/SuperSlicer-profiles/``
